With this script you can copy existed character from Retail World of Warcraft Armory directly to your server database.

Currently script works with MaNGOS DB only. Trinity support will be added when MaNGOS version will be finished.

TODO:
 - Handle all achievements
 - Learn profession spells (not only skills)
 - Handle reputation
 - Handle glyphs

Finished:
 - Character equipment
 - Character achievements (partly)
 - Character talents
 - Weapon spells
 - Maybe something else what I can't remember now =)

Script was tested only with turned off server! Use it at your own risk.

Don't forget to change access rights to _cache and _debug folders (*nix). sql/characters_db.sql should be applied to characters database.

Requirements:
  - HTTP server with PHP support
  - CURL package for PHP
